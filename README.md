# LangGraph-Project
This project is designed to read through text and figure out if itâ€™s talking about the weather. Not only that, it can also pull out details like the location, temperature, conditions, and even the time.  The best part? It works offline with simple rules, and gets even smarter if you connect it to an OpenAI API key.
